                Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm Nancy. I’m a product manager, community builder and action-oriented optimist passionate about harnessing today’s tools to create a better future—and finding awesome people to do it with me! Currently, I lead the development of new task management experiences for Microsoft Planner and serve on the advisory committee for Breaktime, a nonprofit focused on breaking the cycle of young adult homelessness.

            <p><b>How did I get here?</b></p>
            <p>
                Through stargazing trips and hiking trails, my family taught me that 
                our Earth is singlehandedly one of the most beautiful and priceless 
                gifts bestowed to us. From an early age, the word "sustainability" took over 
                my life and career, from small things like persuading my parents to use 
                tote bags and buy water filters, to <a href= "https://youtu.be/70EkbQNXdko">
                building compost bins at my high school</a> and <a href = "https://hub.jhu.edu/at-work/2018/04/19/sustainability-green-blue-jay-awards-2018/">
                organizing the annual career 
                fair for finding sustainability-related careers at Hopkins </a>. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                I credit my college experience for expanding my definition of sustainability from an environmental principle 
                to a fundamental right, integral to social well-being.
                Living in Baltimore meant the city was just as much an educator as my professors: 
                it exposed me to the interconnectedness of social problems and showed me how a united community is necessary for overcoming these issues. 
                I resolved from then on to apply my professional skills towards breaking down socioeconomic barriers.
            </p>
            <p><b>What's next? </b></p>
            <p>
                I hope to use my skills towards breaking down 
                socioeconomic barriers and expanding the accessibility of opportunity 
                to all people. Mostly, though, I'm excited to see where life leads me 
                and for all the people and adventures along the way. Drop me a line at nancy@nancy-wang.com if
                you want to chat - I'd love to get to know you!
