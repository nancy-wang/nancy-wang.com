                Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm Nancy. I’m a product manager, community builder and action-oriented optimist 
                passionate about harnessing today’s tools to create a better future—and finding awesome people to do it with me! 
                Currently, I lead the development of new task management experiences for Microsoft Planner 
                and serve on the advisory committee for Breaktime, a nonprofit focused on breaking the cycle of young adult homelessness.

            <p>
                Through stargazing trips and hiking trails, my family taught me that 
                our Earth is singlehandedly one of the most beautiful and priceless 
                gifts bestowed to us. From an early age, the word "sustainability" took over 
                my life and career, from small things like persuading my parents to use 
                tote bags and buy water filters, to <a href= "https://youtu.be/70EkbQNXdko">
                leading a school-wide campaign to compost food scraps </a> and publishing a mobile app that told people how to dispose of their trash
                sustainably. Through these projects, I began to view technology as an agent for creating social change. I decided
                to study Computer Science in college to learn how to build and use technology to effect positive changes in the world.

                Living in Baltimore during my college years meant the city was just as much an educator as my professors: 
                it exposed me to the interconnectedness of social problems 
                and showed me how a united community is necessary for overcoming these issues. Through volunteering at the Johns
                Hopkins Hospital, I got the opportunity to assist low-income individuals with accessing resources like food stamps,
                healthcare, and employment. I realized then that I wanted to serve as an advocate for people who didn't have a seat at the table,
                and it was this desire that propelled me into my current job as a product manager.

            <p>
                I'm currently exploring:
                <li> <b>public speaking:</b> I caught the public speaking bug after attempting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9WdnZcF0ns">5 minute talk on behavioral economics</a> in a crowd of 500 people! It was 
                    exhilarating, and I'm now seeking other areas where I can share my knowledge in fun ways. Most recently, I gave a talk on making decisions as a product manager for <a href="productfestival.com">Product Festival</a></li>
                <li> <b>chaotic acts of kindness:</b> Something I've come to realize is that any time we deviate from the norm, we unleash an alternative reality of how the world could operate. Through my actions, I want to see how bringing kindness to unexpected places can shape the communities around us. These are already strange times, why not bend it closer to the reality ​we want to live in?
                </li>
                <li> <b>performing music:</b> I've started playing violin again! One of my dreams is to play music on a cruise ship...in the meantime, I'm actively looking for musicians to jam with! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFmTRMHdw4&ab_channel=IsabelladeLeon">See my latest performance here with the Speakeasy Quartet.</a>
                </li>
                Mostly, though, I'm excited to see where life leads me 
                and for all the people and adventures along the way. Drop me a line at nancy@nancy-wang.com if
                you want to chat - I'd love to get to know you!
