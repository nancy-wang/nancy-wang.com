                Hello hello! I'm Nancy, and I'm a senior at Johns Hopkins
                studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm a sister to a 12 year old,
                a residential advisor for freshmen, a current resident of Baltimore,
                Maryland, USA, and most importantly, Mother Earth.

                Through stargazing trips and hiking trails, my family taught me that 
                our Earth is singlehandedly one of the most beautiful and priceless 
                gifts bestowed to us. From an early age, the word "sustainability" took over 
                my life and career, from small things like persuading my parents to use 
                tote bags and buy water filters, to <a href= "https://waghostwriter.com/40982/features/composting-starts-at-wa/">
                building compost bins at my high school</a> and <a href = "https://hub.jhu.edu/at-work/2018/04/19/sustainability-green-blue-jay-awards-2018/">
                organizing the annual career 
                fair for finding sustainability-related careers at Hopkins </a>. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming to Baltimore, I've grown to see sustainability as not just
                an environmental principle, but also integral to social well-being. 
                As a volunteer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, I connect low-income patients 
                with community resources including health insurance, food access,
                and employment. Johns Hopkins Hospital is one of the best
                hospitals in the world, yet I saw the failings of the 
                medical system as patients came back sick because they were unable 
                to afford food. Depressed because they were
                unable to provide for their family. It left me feeling anguished - and 
                driven to do more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to one day use my skills towards breaking down 
                socioeconomic barriers and expanding the accessibility of opportunity 
                to all people. Mostly, though, I'm excited to see where life leads me 
                and for all the people and adventures along the way. *Drop me a line if
                you want to chat - I'd love to get to know you!
